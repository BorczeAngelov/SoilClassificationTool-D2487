      *Disclaimer: You are currently accessing a prototype version of the classification tool. Comprehensive verification
      and testing procedures, encompassing a wide range of soil samples and scenarios, are yet to be completed. A
      certified geotechnical engineer is in the process of verifying the tool's functionality using real-world soil
      samples.

      We strongly recommend users to cross-check the results generated by this tool with the ASTM D2487 standard
      flowcharts and other pertinent technical resources prior to their application in a project environment.

      Please be aware that the utilization of this tool is at the user's sole discretion and risk.
